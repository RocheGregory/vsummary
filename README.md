# NOTICE: Go Rewrite

This project is being rewritten in Go. This branch is **NOT** in a working state, and won't be for a few months.

For the working original PHP based version (with docker images) please see the `php` branch here: https://github.com/gbolo/vSummary/tree/php

Reason for switching to go is purely educational.
